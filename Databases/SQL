For main thing we have to do with data:
Create 
Read 
Update 
Destroy 


Create :- 
// this below code for making the format of table 
CREATE TABLE products(
    id INT NOT NULL , 
    name STRING, 
    price MONEY, 
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

// adding elements into TABLE 
INSERT INTO products
VALUES (1, "Pen", 1.20)


// adding only few values 
INSERT INTO products(id, name)
VALUES (2, "Pencil")


// how to read the data from the table 
* (star) means everything (select everything)
SELECT * from products ;

SELECT name, price from 'products' ;

// HOW to only select a particular column 


SELECT * FROM products WHERE ID = 1 



/// Update THE table 
UPDATE products 
SET price = 0.80
WHERE id = 2 



// ALTER THE TABLE :- add, delete and  modifying the column

ALTER TABLE products 
ADD stock INT 

// deleting elements from table 

DELETE FROM products 
WHERE id = 2 


///  creating a order table for linking customers, products, order 


CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT NOT NULL , 
    order_number INT, 
    customer_id INT , 
    product_id INT, 
    PRIMARY KEY (id) ,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id) ,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id)
)


// creating first order 

INSERT INTO orders 
VALUES (1, 4362, 2, 1) 


// Joining the table together 
// using inner join technique 
/// here is the implementation of order joining with customers 
SELECT orders.order_number,  customers.first_name, customers.last_name, customers.address 
FROM orders 
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id 


/// joining order to products
SELECT orders.order_number, products.name , products.price , products.stock
FROM orders 
INNER JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.id
